listing_description: Docker provides a fast and secure system of containers to deploy an app or website. Docker is suitable for modern applications and delivers reliable hosting services at tremendous scale. Docker packages software into standardised containers for development, deployment and shipment. Each container operates as  a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Docker is best orchestrated by [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).
