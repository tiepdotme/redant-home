Salesforce Marketing Cloud is a powerful messaging platform that can be used to create customer journeys or send specific messages. It can do pretty much anything in terms of customer engagement. SFMC started life with the name "Exact Target", and then became Salesforce Marketing Cloud.

Like many engagement tools, the quality of the data going in is critical. It's important to make sure the customer data is both timely and accurate. Without that, the quality of the messages going out will be degraded.
