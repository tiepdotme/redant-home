**What makes property management so hard?**
Like a few industries we’ve worked in, from the outside looking in, the property management business looks pretty simple.

Here’s how I thought it worked: A tenant signs a lease, and then sets up regular rent payments. These payments go to the owner’s bank account. The property manager gets paid a fee, and everything is pretty simple and sweet.

It’s once you take a look under the hood that you see how messy and hard things can be. In no particular order:

**Problem 1:** Trust accounts
Turns out the money doesn’t just go to the owner. It first goes into a Trust account, which is a special type of bank account the agency must have. This Trust costs the Agency - they need to employ people to manage and audit the account - while at the same time the law prevents them from earning any interest on funds held.


**Problem 2:** Fraud
So you’ve got this big pool of money, and lots of money going in and out. Guess what happens? Obviously this is only in a small percentage of cases, but there are two types of fraud.

The first is money coming in for PropertyA, which is used to pay for a cost on PropertyB. PropertyB’s rent hasn’t yet come in, but the cost needs to get paid. Sure, it will probably all even out, but it does mean the owner of PropertyA won’t get paid straight away.

Very hard to detect, and this might occur deliberately or by accident.
The second type is more straight up fraud:

- NSW real estate agent [Daniel Nicholson](http://www.realestatebusiness.com.au/breaking-news/11202-agent-jailed-over-trust-account-fraud) was prosecuted after he failed to lodge almost $93,000 in trust funds
- [One agent who fraudulently used the funds](https://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/millions-in-nsw-real-estate-fraud-prompts-raft-of-new-regulations-20161124-gsx3gf.html) to purchase illegal drugs used by his wife.
- Another [whose father reported her to Fair Trading](https://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/1982022/warilla-agent-feeds-101m-into-pokies/) after she stole more than $1.5 million from her real estate agency to use on poker machines.
- Gambling addiction is identified as a common motivator for trust account fraud, as was the case for one agent who bet $77,000 of trust funds in one day.

**Problem 3:** Margins and outsourcing
Managing a portfolio of rental properties can be very time consuming, and the wage cost might not always align with revenue. This is in contrast to the Sales side of an agency, where new sales align with commissions paid to agents.

This drives a desire to keep costs down, and so some agencies explore outsourcing options such as using staff in offshore centres to manage trust funds. The regulator (eg: Office of Fair Trading in NSW) doesn’t look kindly on this, and processing data in this way would make it difficult to meet the tougher new Data and Privacy obligations.

**Problem 4:** Speed of payments


**Problem 5:** Complexity of payments

- Overdue payments
- Everyone has a different POV
- rocessing time of transactions
- Variations of a lease
- Change frequency
- Apply credit
- Overpaid
- Money not available
- Details change
