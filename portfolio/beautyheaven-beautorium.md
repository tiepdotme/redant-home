#### Project Description

Beautorium is a popup / flash style store where Beautyheaven members can buy health and beauty products using their loyalty points. To buy product, a member needs to be of [a certain points level,](/portfolio/beautyheaven/) and then you can use your points to buy product. A member can choose to use a combination of products to buy.

This was an interesting project, as it helped us understand the power of introducing a viable loyalty based system to members. And most importantly, having this store allowed members to be able to redeem those points to buy product

In 2015 BH was [acquired by Bauer Media](http://www.bauer-media.com.au/discover/press/announcements/2015/03/bauer-media-acquires-leading-digital-beauty-business-the-beautyheaven-group/), and integrated into their existing digital platform.
