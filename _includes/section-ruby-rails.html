              Ruby on Rails speeds up many of the simple tasks, and allows for
              extremely rapid creation of prototypes and working code. It also
              uses “best practice” by default, so you’re not relying on the whim
              of a particular developer. Of course, having a smart developer is
              critical, and Rails allows them to translate ideas and concepts
              quickly and efficiently.

              Working in an Agile fashion, we can create code that can then be
              reviewed that day. We might be heading in the right direction, or
              it might need to behave differently. Rapid change and evolution is
              a good thing. Using Ruby on Rails facilitates this.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ruby on Rails also helps us create very high quality code. Each
              part of code has
              <a href="/automated-testing/testing-web-projects-in-rails/"
                >a series of Automated Tests</a
              >. These perform checks to make sure that feature is working as it
              should. These get run every time a change is made. By doing this,
              we know that one change hasn’t broken something else. As soon as
              anything breaks or changes, our Continuous Integration server lets
              us know and the code is fixed.
