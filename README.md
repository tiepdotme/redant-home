# Red Ant Website

[![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

The Red Ant Website based on [Jekyll + Webpack](https://github.com/red-ant/jekyll-webpack).

The app uses a standard Jekyll structure with all uncompiled asset source files
located in `./_webpack`.

## Quick start with yarn :runner:

Ensure ruby & node are installed with the .ruby-version & .node-version included, and preferably have yarn installed otherwise use npm.

```
cd ~/src
git clone git@github.com:red-ant/redant-home.git
cd redant-home
bundle install && yarn install
yarn start
open http://localhost:4000
```

If nokogiri fails, then try:

```
bundle config build.nokogiri --use-system-libraries --with-xml2-include=$(brew --prefix libxml2)/include/libxml2
```

Alternatively you can use the supplied docker-compose to get up and running:

```
docker-compose up
```

## Commiting

In order to keep code style minimally consistent this project has stylelint for SCSS, eslint for JS and [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) configured.
Linting will run automatically when attempting to add a new commit

Run linting manually:

```bash
$ yarn lint
```

Bypass pre-commit linting:

```bash
$ git commit -m "<YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE>" --no-verify
```

## Updating portfolio order

In the file `/_data/portfolio.json` you can change the order of the projects shown in the portfolio page by changing the order of the slugs.

```
{
  "order": [
    "page-slug-1",
    "page-slug-2",
    "page-slug-3",
    "page-slug-4"
  ]
}
```

## Updating content

Use forestry.io -> https://redant.com.au/admin

**Project image sizes:** Project images for desktop on the project detail header might vary in size. The desktop images are recalculated to 45.92% of the original image height in pixels and the default size is 729px. If an image is smaller than this default size, then you will have to add the calculated pixel height (to be supplied by Kap) in the project markdown file under the parameter `desktop_img_height`.

Generally all images for posts / pages should be uploaded and handled through the forestry cms. Uploaded images live in `/assets/uploads`.

Assets used within templates should live within `/assets/layout`.

Assets loaded within js or css are handled by webpack and should reside in `_webpack/images`. Within SASS files images can be referenced with a `~` as below:

```
.class-name {
  background-image: url('~images/folder123/folder123-image.jpg');
}
```

### Forestry

Forestry front matters and settings are in the `.forestry` folder.
Forestry uses the `yarn preview` & `yarn build` scripts.

All forestry page asset uploads are set to go into the `/assets/uploads` folder.

## Release / Deploy

Forestry will compile and deploy the site when saving changes or pushing.

The site can be deployed to gh-pages manually with:

```
yarn release
```

## Deploying to the dev environment

Setup heroku

```
heroku git:remote -a redant-dev
```

Make sure you login to heroku

```
heroku login
```

Push release to heroku

```
git push -f heroku my-branch-name:master
```

## AMP

AMP requires a customised css file that requires the minimum Bootstrap styles to render posts. This is handled by webpack using the amp.js entrypoint which compiles to /assets/amp.[hash].css.

- `src/styles/amp/` contains all custom AMP styles. This is required because AMP limits the stylesheet size to 50kb and has constraints that our custom styles need to adhere to.
- `script/amp` is called post build which copies `/assets/amp.[hash].css` to `_includes/amp/index.css` for Jekyll to consume. This is handled by webpack using the `src/amp.js` entrypoint which compiles to `/assets/amp.[hash].css`.
- `_layouts/amp.html` is the main template the amp-jekyll plugin uses to generate the AMP pages
- `_includes/amp` contains the customised headers and elements AMP needs in order to be valid
- Reference at [amp-jekyll plugin](https://github.com/juusaw/amp-jekyll) and [here](https://nbsoftsolutions.com/blog/creating-a-parallel-amp-site-with-jekyll).
