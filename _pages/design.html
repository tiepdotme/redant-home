    <p>You've probably got an idea of where you'd like to get to. Typically this might be a commercial version of your MVP. Something good enough to pay for.</p>
    <p>To get to that point you're going to need quite a few things:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>good project management,</li>
    <li>to make the right technical + product decisions,</li>
    <li>choose the right technology,</li>
    <li>and create a user experience that works.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>You need a well rounded team that can work together to deliver each of those aspects.<hr></p>
