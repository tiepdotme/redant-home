#### Project Description

Waterwise gardening, growing your own food, organic gardening, community – these are the themes of a new generation of gardeners. We have helped Yates to share their immense knowledge of plants and pests to develop an engaging and informative website that helps gardeners solve problems and inspires them to have a go. Garden care is specific to where you live – this site provides solutions for your region.

Bits we’re especially proud of:

* Garden expert - gardeners can ask the Yates Experts a question, and browse other answers in a Garden Care Q&A.
* Vegie Challenge - blog your journey and find out what works best in your local vegie growing community.
* Virtual Garden - use this interactive tool to visualise your perfect garden and plan what you need.
* Garden problem solver on iPhone & iPad – solve your garden problems and create your shopping list.
